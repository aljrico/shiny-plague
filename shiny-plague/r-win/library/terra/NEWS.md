- `focalReg` for focal OLS regression models between layers 


# version 1.4-20

- new method `vect<list>` to append SpatVectors (faster than `do.call(rbind, x)`)
- new argument `align=FALSE` to `project` to align to the template SpatRaster but ignore the resolution

# version 1.4-7

Released on 2021-10-05

## note

`terra` no longer depends on `raster`. To avoid name clashes between these two packages, and to allow replacing methods from `rgeos` and `rgdal` in `raster`, `raster` now depends on `terra` instead.

Released on 2021-06-20

## new

- `na.omit<SpatVector>` to remove empty geometries and/or attribute records that have an `NA`
- new method `src` to create a `SpatRasterCollection` (a loose collection of tiles).

- improved handling (and documentation) of `gstat` models by `interpolate`. See issue [#208](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/208) by Jakub Nowosad.
- new argument `cpkgs` to `predict` to list the packages that need to be exported to the cores if argument `cores` is larger than one. `?predict` now shows different approaches to parallelize `predict` (based on examples in issue [#178](
https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/178) raised by by Matthew Coghill).
- `freq` now returns labels for categorical layers
- `adjacent` now has a `pairs` argument. Requested by Kenneth Blake Vernon in issue [#239](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/239)

- time attributes are no longer lost when doing raster operations. Suggested by Mauricio Zambrano-Bigiarini in [#246]( https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/246)
- resample (and project) no longer ignore `gdal=""` write options and use BIGTIFF if necessary (suggested by Ani Ghosh)
- new argument `layer` in the `extract-SpatRaster,SpatVector` method to extract values for a single layers specified for each geometry (see this [question](https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/401591/8993)).

## bug fixes 

- better handling of paths with non-ASCII characters (e.g., Chinese) for GeoTiff but still fails for NetCDF (see issue [#233](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/223) by Dongdong Kong)
- `extract` with points and `cells=TRUE` or `xy=TRUE` gave garbled output
- `as.character<SpatRaster>` (called by `wrap`) did not capture the layer names. Reported by Pascal Title [#213](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/213)
- `focal` mirrored the weight matrix, thus affecting the results when using an asymmetrical weight matrix. Reported by Sebastiano Trevisani
- `terra::terraOptions` now works without attaching the package (issue [#229](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/229) reported by Karl Dunkle Werner)
- `app` with `ncores > 0` and a function that returns multiple layers now works (issue [#240](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/240) reported by BastienFR.
- `autocor` (local) can now handle `NA` values. Reported by Jakub Nowosad [#245](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/245).
